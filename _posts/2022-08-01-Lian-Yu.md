First we do a port scan 

nmap -sC -sV -p- -oN scan.txt THM-IP -v

We get open ports :
21			-ftp
22			-ssh
80			-http
111			-rpcbind 2-4
43798  			-rpc

Now let's do an enumeration on that http web server.

gobuster dir -u http://THM-IP/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt > gob.txt
<img src= "https://github.com/katanush/katanush.github.io/blob/main/images/lianyu/gob1.png?raw=true">


And so we find the directory

<img src= "https://github.com/katanush/katanush.github.io/blob/main/images/lianyu/first2.png?raw=true">

In the directory we have a hidden word and we can do another enumeration on that directory :

gobuster dir -u http://THM-IP/island -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt > island.txt

<img src= "https://github.com/katanush/katanush.github.io/blob/main/images/lianyu/smald.png?raw=true">


Viewing the source page of the second directory we can see some other things :D now lets find out what exactly

<img src= "https://github.com/katanush/katanush.github.io/blob/main/images/lianyu/second.png?raw=true">

This looks like there might be a file with that extension inside the directory so lets find out

gobuster dir -u http://THM-IP/island/2100 -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt -x .ticket > ticket

<img src= "https://github.com/katanush/katanush.github.io/blob/c47b821b11f4e304e7d722ad51aee3f2bdf6f6f5/images/lianyu/tick.png?raw=true">


Inside the file we get the encoded password for FTP where we can see there is another user and some files. It looks like a base58 .

<img src= "https://github.com/katanush/katanush.github.io/blob/4d89803ef4f7e39b26c6f591a1890198f62cc65b/images/lianyu/3rd.png">

Now that we got FTP acces with the decoded password we can see some files in there so lets get them on our machine and find out what they've got and dont forget that we found another user too.

<img src="https://github.com/katanush/katanush.github.io/blob/4d89803ef4f7e39b26c6f591a1890198f62cc65b/images/lianyu/ftp-con.png">


One of the images looks broken if we have a look at it within a hexeditor we can see the first 6 chars are not correct for a png file so i replaced them with 89 50 4E 47 0D 0A and we got the picture:

Now lets se if there is anything else in the other pictures. 

steghide extract -sf aa.jpg  using the password we got from the other one 

<img src= "">

Seem like we got 2 files and one of them contains a password ? maybe for shh the other user ?

as we have ssh connection we do the sudo -l and find out we can run pkexec as root
