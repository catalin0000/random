First we do a port scan 

nmap -sC -sV -p- -oN scan.txt THM-IP -v

We get open ports :
21			-ftp
22			-ssh
80			-http
111			-rpcbind 2-4
43798  			-rpc

Now let's do an enumeration on that http web server.

gobuster dir -u http://THM-IP/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt > gob.txt
<img src= "https://github.com/katanush/katanush.github.io/blob/8cabdba5230dcc8500d40ef9b9e800665d589e28/images/lianyu/gob1.png">


And so we find the directory

In the directory we have a hidden word and we can do another enumeration on that directory

Viewing the source page of the directory we can see some other things :D now lets find out what exactly

<img src= "">

gobuster dir -u http://THM-IP/island/2100 -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt -x .ticket > ticket

Inside the file we get the encoded password for FTP where we can see there is another user and some files.

One of the images looks broken if we have a look at it within a hexeditor we can see the first 6 chars are not correct for a png file so i replaced them with 89 50 4E 47 0D 0A .

Now lets se if there is anything else in the other pictures. 

steghide extract -sf aa.jpg  using the password we got from the other one 

Seem like we got 2 files and one of them contains a password ? maybe for shh the other user ? 




as we have ssh connection we do the sudo -l and find out we can run pkexec as root
